# SP FED CA2 Bootstrap and JavaScript for 2023-2024

#### To Do for Pre-Submission 5% Marks
- Nav bar
- Page header
- Use of columns
- Responsive to 3 breakpoints
****

#### Suggestions for the 4th page
Either:
- Create a user registration form for a Save the Earth newsletter.
- Create a feedback form about your page.
****

#### Suggestions for using JavaScript in your website
Either (or try doing all of these):
- Have a clock that shows the current time (Cengage Lesson 9 Coding Challenge 1).
- Have a countdown timer where you can set the start time (make use of a Boostrap form `input` control and a submit button, and see the code in Cengage Lesson 9 Coding Challenge 2).
- Your Bootstrap form on the 4th page has a submit button. When this button is clicked, all the information that was filled out in the form is shown in an alert window.

#### Notes
- To create a submit button, you can use the `onclick` event handler, so that clicking the button will run some JavaScript code. See https://www.w3schools.com/JSREF/event_onclick.asp for sample code.
- Once you create a submit button, you can omit the `action=` attribute in the `form` tag, because the button handles the form processeing, instead of sending the form data to the URL given by the `action` attribute.

****

#### Using JavaScript properties to amend HTML (this is for the "JavaScript properties" in the CA2 rubrik)
- These are properties such as `.value` '.innerHTML', etc.
- To acess/amend these properties, we often use `document.getElementById("someId").value` and `document.getElementById("someId").innerHTML` (see Cengage Chapter 9.8).

****

#### Reminders
- Fill out and sign the Academic Integrity form and submit it together with your assignnent.
